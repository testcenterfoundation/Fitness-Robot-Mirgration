# Fitnesse Robot Migration

Introduction:

In the fast-paced world of software development, test automation is a critical component in ensuring the stability and reliability of applications. Many organizations, including yours, have traditionally relied on Selenium WebDriver in Java to automate their web applications. This has provided robust support for browser interactions, allowing teams to create comprehensive test suites. However, with the growing complexity of web applications and the need for faster, more reliable testing tools, a transition to more modern solutions becomes essential.

This is where Robot Framework combined with the Browser plugin comes in as a powerful alternative. Built on top of Playwright, the Browser plugin offers significant performance improvements, better handling of asynchronous web interactions, and a more user-friendly syntax for testers of all skill levels. Moreover, the shift from Java code to Robot Framework's keyword-driven approach brings in simplicity and clarity, making test cases easier to read, maintain, and scale.

But how do you migrate from your established Selenium Java WebDriver tests to this new framework without starting from scratch? The answer lies in a structured approach to migrationâ€”adapting your existing test logic, rewriting test cases in Robot Framework, and ensuring smooth integration with the Browser plugin. This document will guide you through the entire migration process, from understanding the key differences between Selenium and Playwright, to automating parts of the transition, and optimizing your new test setup.

The journey of migration not only modernizes your test automation but also paves the way for faster, more reliable test execution and greater productivity within your team
